# Graph Networks

This repository contains a python script which reads input from the file about the nodes and their weights and shows graphical representation of the edges and the nodes using NetworkX Library. Later you can implement different algorithms like Prims, Dijkstra and many others to know and visualize information given in the form of nodes and edges.

### About the input files

There are 10 different input files uploaded in the repository which consists of nodes, edges and their weights. Nodes are ranged from 10 to 100. You can try your own file with any number of nodes, edges and weights in the pattern available in the sample input files.

### About the project

The interface was created using tkinter library and the graphs were made using NetworkX library               
Some of the interfaces of the program are attached below:

   - After Selecting the nodes you can use your file to visualize and apply multiple algorithms on your graph
